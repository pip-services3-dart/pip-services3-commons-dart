/// Interface for data objects that can be versioned.
///
/// Versioning is often used as optimistic concurrency mechanism.
///
/// The version doesn't have to be a number, but it is recommended to use sequential
/// values to determine if one object has newer or older version than another one.
///
/// It is a common pattern to use the time of change as the object version.
///
/// ### Example ###
///
///     class MyData implements IStringIdentifiable, IVersioned {
///          String id;
///         String  field1;
///         int field2;
///         String version;
///         ...
///     }
///
///      void updateData(String correlationId, MyData item ) {
///         ...
///         if (item.version < oldItem.version) {
///             throw  ConcurrencyException(null, 'VERSION_CONFLICT', 'The change has older version stored value');
///         }
///         ...
///     }

abstract class IVersioned {
  /// The object's version.
  abstract String version;
